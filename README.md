Script converts GTA VC radio stations (Flash FM and Emotion) to FiveM. It's server-side, so everyone who join will hear it ;)
I just want to say thanks to authors of those mods (without them there'll be no script so):

Thank you very much, full respect!
There's no radio files, so you need to download it from gta5-mods.com and then paste it into right folders, like radio_14_dance_02 and radio_16_silverlake.
